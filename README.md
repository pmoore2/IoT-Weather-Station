# IoT-Weather-Station
I created a weather station that I created using IoT devices including a Raspberry Pi 3, ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller, and DHT11, BMP280, and CCS811 sensors. I was motivated to do this project to create my first embedded system and leverage IoT devices to collect and transmit weather data over the MQTT protocol.

The final breadboard of the weather station showing the hardware and wiring is shown in The weather station uses an ESP8266 NodeMCU as the publisher, equipped with DHT11 (temperature/humidity), BMP280 (pressure), and CCS811 (air quality) sensors, while a Raspberry Pi 3 hosts the Mosquitto MQTT broker and Node-RED for data visualization. Although the project encountered hardware issues, particularly with the CCS811 sensor, it successfully demonstrated the setup of the MQTT ecosystem. Key learnings included the lightweight and flexible nature of MQTT, ideal for IoT applications, but also its security limitations, such as lack of native encryption, leaving data vulnerable to interception. The project provided hands-on experience with Arduino sketches, IoT hardware, and MQTT's publisher-subscriber model, while highlighting the importance of security considerations in IoT deployments. Future work aims to add email notifications and explore security vulnerabilities like credential sniffing.
